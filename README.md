## Introduction

To improve water quality and support sustainable company growth, efforts are being made to identify, analyze, and address water pollution. Utilizing a data-driven approach, the focus is on generating solutions that benefit the company while also creating significant positive impacts on public health and environmental sustainability. Through holistic and strategic efforts, the goal is to shape a cleaner and more sustainable future for all stakeholders involved.

## Conclusion

The conclusions drawn from this data analysis are as follows:

1. **Heavy Industry and Metal Mining:**
   - This area likely represents a heavy industrial zone associated with metal mining activities such as zinc, tin, or copper.
   - Heavy industrial activities like metal manufacturing, waste processing, or chemical production may lead to the release of various heavy metals into the surrounding environment.

2. **Poor Sanitation Infrastructure:**
   - Inadequate sanitation infrastructure or lack of proper sanitation facilities can lead to water pollution with bacteria, viruses, and harmful chemical compounds.
   - Ineffective wastewater treatment systems can contaminate surface water and groundwater.

3. **High Geological Activity:**
   - There is a possibility of high geological activity such as volcanism or the formation of rocks rich in certain minerals, which can lead to water containing toxic compounds like arsenic, uranium, and radium.

4. **Mining Waste Impact:**
   - Poorly managed mining waste can pollute surface water and groundwater with heavy metals such as cadmium, aluminum, and selenium.
   - Washing processes or mining tailings can increase the risk of water contamination in surrounding areas.

5. **Public Health:**
   - Water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals can pose serious health risks to local communities.
   - Addressing existing water pollution issues requires remediation efforts and stringent environmental management to protect public health and sustain the environment.

## Model Development

- It is recommended to use optimal C parameter tuning.
  
- Consider using other kernels such as RBF, polynomial, or sigmoid.

- When dealing with large datasets, it is advisable to use PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

- Increasing the amount of data can be beneficial.

- Perform data balancing techniques.
